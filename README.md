# Credit Analysis
## Introduction

In this project, an analysis was conducted to find out how the customer's characteristics influence the customer's ability to repay the loan. What is the customer's marital status and the number of their family, in this case the number of children, can be an interesting test of how this affects the ability of customers to pay off credit.

## Data Sources

The data used is the result of an assessment of the score at a particular bank by displaying information on the characteristics of the bank's customers.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas


## Conclusion
There is an influence on the number of children with the potential to default on the submitted credit. This shows that clients who have children automatically have higher expenses. Higher expenses make it more difficult for customers' finances to pay credit loans on time.
